<h1 align='center'> Python Web Scraping Repository 🕸️🐍</h1>



Welcome to the Python Web Scraping repository! This repository contains web scraping projects using Python, where I've scraped data from various websites and APIs to gather valuable information for analysis.

## Projects

### 🕷️ Selenium: Scraping Facebook Page Comments 📝

[View Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Saifmechi/Python-Web-Scraping/blob/main/Selenuim_Scraping_Facebook_Page_Comments.ipynb)

In this project, I've developed a web scraping script using Selenium to extract comments from Facebook pages. The script allows you to specify the number of comments you want to scrape and automatically loads more comments by clicking the "Voir plus de commentaires" (See more comments) button multiple times.
The script utilizes Python, Selenium WebDriver, and BeautifulSoup to navigate through Facebook's dynamic content and extract the comments from the comments frame. It provides an efficient and automated way to gather comments for in-depth analysis or sentiment analysis.


### 💼 Glassdoor Companies Web Scraping 🔍

In this project, I've scraped job listing data from Glassdoor to analyze and compare job opportunities among different companies. The notebook includes data scraping, data preprocessing, and data analysis to provide insights into the job market.


### 🛒 Jumia & Tunisianet Comparative Analysis 📈

[View Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Saifmechi/Python-Web-Scraping/blob/main/jumia%26tunisianet%20(2).ipynb)

In this project, I've scraped product data from both Jumia and Tunisianet e-commerce websites and performed a comparative analysis. The notebook includes data extraction, data cleaning, and data visualization to understand the differences and similarities between the two platforms.


## Skills 🔧

These projects demonstrate my skills in web scraping, data extraction, data cleaning, and data analysis using Python and relevant libraries like `Selenuim`, `BeautifulSoup` and `Requests`.

## Usage 🖱️

To run these projects on your machine, make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can view and execute the Jupyter notebooks directly in your local environment.

Feel free to explore the code and project details in each notebook. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out! 💬
